### Project Description
The Multi Useless Website is a place to play quirky, pointless games and explore an unusual information section. Each section has a surprising twist‚Äîthe images you see may not match the content inside.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
LACK OF USELESS ENTERTAINMENT AND FUN WAY TO LEARN SOMETHING

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
CREATED A FUNNY ENCYCLOPEDIA WHICH SHOWS CERTAIN IMAGES AND WHEN CLICKED ON IT, IT WILL SHOW DETAILS OF OTHER OBJECTS WITH SAME NAME BUT DIFFERENT MEANING AND ALSO SOME USELESS GAMES FOR ENTERTAINMENT.
